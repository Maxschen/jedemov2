<small>If you got a good Schema and/or JavaScript examples that show off some of the more advanced features of JSON-Editor, please post it on the JSON-Editor Interactive Playground [GitHub page](https://github.com/pmk65/jedemov2/issues). I will then evaluate it and add it to the list of available examples. ðŸš€</small>

### Custom JavaScript

In the JavaScript editor, the instance of the form is available in the variable ``jseditor`` and the schema and startval (if present) are available in the variable ``jedata``.
Also the global instance of the JSON-Editor is available in the variable ``JSONEditor``.

You can add custom JavaScript code above and below the mandatory (readonly) lines.

#### Special Comments

Two special comment functions are available in the JavaScript editor for creating more complex setups.

* **includeJS()** - Includes a custom JavaScript file.
* **includeCSS()** - Includes a custom JavaScript file.

For these to be recognized, they MUST be place inside a // comment tag.
