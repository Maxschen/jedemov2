## JSON-Editor Playground

The **JSON-Editor Interactive Playground** is a playground page where you can test various setups for the OpenSource JSON Schema parser [JSON-Editor](https://github.com/json-editor/json-editor#json-editor)

Here you can try various predefined examples or create your own schema and JavaScript test setups.

<small>If you got a good Schema and/or JavaScript examples that show off some of the more advanced features of JSON-Editor, please post it on the JSON-Editor Interactive Playground [GitHub page](https://github.com/pmk65/jedemov2/issues). I will then evaluate it and add it to the list of available examples. ðŸš€</small>
